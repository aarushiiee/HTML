                Hey,
                I guess those colours are beautiful,
                It must be very unique to feel special.
                Life is beautiful though but,
                Those colours of yours give me the hope,
                That colours make it look mesmerizing.
                I love the way you fly,
                Independent and carefree,
                I wish i would have been flying the same way you do,
                Carefree of society and Independent of expectations.
                I love the way you caresses the flower,
                The intensity of your touch,
                And the feeling you encounter,
                Fills my heart with emotions.

            <p>First ray of sun!
                Is not only the transition of nighttime into day,
                But also the line between dark and light.
                It is the ray of hope that,
                The better sight is just a line away.
                It is the ray that vanishes all your anxieties,
                It is the ray that enlightens your soul,
                It is the ray that makes you recognize your true self,
                It dribbles its delight,
                To welcome abundance of miracles that,
                Fills your day with euphoria.
                It brings light, joy, positivity to the lives of people.
                It might be possible that,
                The first ray of your sun hasn't reached yet,
                But it must be notched away.
                And we welcome it as AARUSHI.

            <p>To my best friends out there.
                You are not my best friend,
                You are my safe place,
                My happy place,
                And my sad place,
                You are me , being me , getting me.
                You are my bitch.
                We bitches rocks.
                I love the way you smile,
                when you understand what my eyes meant,
                I love the way you lie,
                When you realize I'm stating the wrong facts.
                I love the way you guard me,
                When you know I'm in need of support.
                I love the way you caresses me,
                When i am facing the lowest day.
                I love the way you teach me,
                The rights and wrongs i did.
                I love the way you taunt me,
                When i almost denied your guidance,
                And that turns out to be a great one.
                I love the way you distract me,
                During the most serious conversations.
                I love the way you make me,
                The best self of me.
                I know i never show how much much i adore you and always say " i hate you ".
                Never minding what the situation is,
                But you always get my feelings precisely.
                No matter what, when, where, and how
                You always make yourself available for me.
                No matter what time of the day it is,
                Your never-ending support remains intact.
                Proving the bond we share.
                No matter what i say and how unfortunate you feel by my words,
                But you never reject me for my stubbornness,  annoyance,  craziness,  impatience, hyperactiveness, attitude, ego and all the bad qualities i avail.
                Thank you for EVERYTHING !
                And yeah my ringtone,
                " WHEN THE SUNSHINE WE SHINE TOGETHER "
                does mean something and i mean actually mean it
                Thank you for bearing me in all ups n downs.

                The only thing we all crave for,
                Whether we are young or old.
                They are those whom you can call up at 3 a.m.
                And that is what actually matters.
                It's always a magical moment when these idiots are around...
                They will never make you feel that you look stupid for caring so so much.
                But yeah magical moments are magical only when FAKENESS is miles away...!!!
                I you he she them everyone are in a constant rush towards...
                WHAT, Towards WHAT????
                The success... materialistic success and that's where fakeness dives in.
                People nowadays wear masks.!
                It's making me feel more detached from this world,
                As u cannot show the real side of yourself.
                Somewhere or the other with the flow 
                Fakeness show up naturally.
                All are hiding their pain behind the oriented elation.
                But...
                It's them who shows how much you mean to them,
                Make you realize that real attachments are still alive.
                They are gonna understand your pain behind that elation.
                They will show up everytime you are broken, 
                Everytime you feel detached from everything,
                Everytime you are facing tough times.
                They are gonna love you for who you are,
                And what an amazing individual you are becoming Despite of all the flaws you carry. 
                They might not be by your side in your happy moments But they will definitely stand still in bad ones.
                Lucky are those who have bestfriend 
                But luckiest are those who have whole squad by their side in every turn of life.
                Don't loose them,
                Always stay connected to them.They are the real ones beside your family.
                Remind them every now n then how much you love them, 
                And you can't imagine your life without them.

            <p>
                The older i get the better i realize that putting myself first isn't being selfish, it's necessary.
                Bcoz what people do is just blame you for everything going in thejr life.
                You become the reason for their problems
                You become the reason behind their health issues
                You become the reason behind low mental wellness
                You become the reason behind every shit they are going through or facing .
                No matter whether it is the opposite or equally impacting to both of you

                So it's better if you focus on your mental health your progress your problems you needs your wants.
                Rather than caring for every single thing one needs one aspires. The more you do for someone the more they take you for granted, they are never gonna be satisfied with what you do...
                But it doesn't mean you should stop helping or caring for others. Do it. But put limits so you both gets
                So just live your life... mind your own business.

            <p>I Miss You
                Is a very small sentence
                But it's meaning deep down
                Is so intense that 
                It can make you feel happy
                And love you for the time being
                And make you cry
                Feeling the power emotions in a different way.
                It is a cherish like emotion to feel.
                When you miss him,
                It feels like shouting.
                When you miss him,
                You feel like hugging him so tight
                And never let him go again.
                You wish you would have not been lying to you
                About how you feel,
                And hugged him tight.
                It is the most beautiful feeling to miss someone.
                When you miss him,
                You even like those habits of him you don't like much.
                The way he drinks his cigarette,
                Also makes you feel like going back to him.
                And also the way he teases you with his words,
                Is what you miss.
                His chest feels like a steady rock that protects you from the storm.
                His smell remains intact with you,
                And has so much power that can take your breath away.
                His way of sitting beside you reminds you of him whenever you sit on those benches.
                The way he wraps his arms around you
                Makes you feel overwhelming.
                He is different from the people i met before,
                Starts making sense to you.
                When he says you are mine.
                I believe him he does posses me.
                I feel like keeping him close to me.
                The only thing is that
                Days becomes shorter and shorter
                When he is around.
                Days becomes longer and even more longer
                When he is not around.

                To cherish those little moments of joy.
                And steadily face the storms that comes into their lives.
                You are the strength they require
                And the weakness that strengthens their soul.
                You are their life
                And the world they posses,
                So keep them safe in your arms
                And never let them go
                Because they are the ones who love you the way you are ,
                And respect you every now and then
                They are the ones who want to be with you for the rest of their lives come what may.
                I didn't fell in love with you
                Because i need you,
                Or wanted to date someone
                Or wanted you
                But i fell for you for the reason that
                You entered my life when no one did
                You protected me when i was also incapable of doing so.
                You loved me when no one else did.

            <p>They told me there is a war between man and woman

                But i never felt that way.
                When you let me in i realized
                It's okay if a man cries and a woman doesn't,
                It's okay if you do silly things / feel weak sometimes,
                It's okay if you feel jealous,
                It's okay if you try to look handsome,
                And don't meet the expectations of others,
                It's okay if you don't pay the bills at times.
                I know i can't heal the hurt you feel deep down
                But i wanna hold your hands,
                Like the world has never held a man
                I want you to know that 
                You can share with us,
                The obstacles you encounter,
                The emotional breakdown you feel,
                The pressure that bears you down,
                And everything you feel is a burden.
                So, stop bottling up your emotions!
                From boyhood to manhood.
                We've the same responsibilities
                And the same norms apply.
                Don't hide your pain
                B'coz of what people say,
                They don't matter, You Do!
                And remember...
                There is no such definition of real man,
                You know that so BE THE WAY YOU ARE.

            <p>Mom, Maa, Amma, Aai, Mumma, whatever you call her

                The word itself has that healing power, that magic 
                Which drops every single thing that brings you down, 
                Also the power to make the impossible possible.
                I know this sounds a bit filmed but go look into it is for sure authentic.
                The word is overwhelming in itself, brings different emotions.
                She scolds you, loves you, cares for you, 
                My mom is the coolest
                She always says "be bold",
                You don't have to be afraid of anyone, 
                Do whatever you wanna do,
                I am there grabbing your back,
                Live how you wanna live,
                Don't let anyone else has the keys to your success,
                It's only you who is gonna endeavour and savour it.
                And these are not just words, she meant every single utterance.
                She believes to breathe on your terms and conditions.
                Thank you Mom for giving rise to the individual I am.
                Thank you, for being my mom and educator at the same time.
                Thank you, for having my back in every circumstance.
                Yeah!
                You are insecure about me, and I understand your anxiety.
                The way you treat me no one else can, 
                The way you believe in me no else will, 
                The way you care and heal me no one else does.
                Your love can't be defined, I will fall short of words.
                I don't know how to sum up these feeling together, 
                But be there with me 'cause you are essential in my life.

            <p>We are not equal

                We are different,
                
                Yes..!!
                Sister is not equal to her sister
                and also not to her brother.
                Wife is not equal to her husband
                
                So in short female is not equal to female 
                How the hell in this universe you expect
                Men and women to be equal
                
                Not better not worse,
                But still not equal.
                Yes.! We are not even created equal.
                
                
                Every single relationship every single individual has it's own bag of responsibilities, duties and ways of proving/ practicing it.
                They have role to perform. And No one can exchange each other's role as they are important and unique in their own way.
                We can't judge them or tag them equal or consider one weak coz of one's superiority in a particular practice. Stop letting yourself down by stupid comparisons. 
                NO you should be of what and who you are.

                I know I don't give you all the peace 
                That you deserve and you want 
                I know I mess up everything  every single time
                I know I hurt you 
                I know you are upset because of me.
                I know I don't get you when I should
                I don't understand things at the right time
                I only realize them after the whole thing goes wrong.
                I might be wrong most of the time

                I know I might not be the best girlfriend 
                Yes I get jealous,  and I feel insecure

                Yes I'm angry all the time

                Just because of my anger 
                Because my love for you >>>....>> my anger
                At last, I promise you I'll never fight with you or taunt you every hour of the day.
                I would get jealous but will never fight with you because of that 
                I should learn that I'm loved 
                I know that you love me and will never leave me

                You always make my mistakes go away.
                You make me a better person.
                Thank you for staying with me after all the fights.
                And I would never do anything that will make me lose you

            <p>To the boy she love -

                If you ever hold her hand
                she is never gonna let you go.
                If you'll grab her by the waist close to yours
                she will never ever let anyone come that close.
                If you'll care for her 
                she will make sure that you never get hurt.
                If you'll ever trust her 
                she will always only spice it up
                The day you came into her life, 
                she stated you as the only one.
                She never wanted that romanticizing relationship 
                But a relationship filled with 
                Love, Care, Positivity,  Trust, Protectiveness, Possessiveness, Jelousy, Happiness,  Ups and Downs etc etc....
                She need nothing from you just
                Want to be the reason behind your smile when you wake up.
                Want to be the reason behind you working hard (behind your success).
                Wants to be the reason behind your laugh.
                Wants to be the reason behind you driving safe.
                Wants to be the reason behind you paying attention to your looks.
                Wants to be the reason you feel loved.
                Wants to be the reason of you being a gentleman.
                She doesn't want all your time,
                She doesn't want your money,
                She doesn't need your gifts,
                She doesn't want you to be around 24/7,
                She doesn't need your attention all the the time.
                What she wants is 
                A little bit of your time about the whole day.
                She wants you be with her physically or mentally.
                She wants you to be her strength.
                Not just for days, months or years 
                She want to be with you for all the birth on way.

                Woh bura nahi acha hai.
